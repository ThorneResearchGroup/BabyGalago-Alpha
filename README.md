Baby Galago Server

Galago was made as an alternative to the current market offerings. While there are other programs that do similar things
to what we're doing, but no one does it quite like us. Give the system a try to see exactly what we mean! We offer a
pay-what-you-can pricing scheme for you to get started, though currently we're still in Alpha, so we've decided to allow
everyone to access everything for free until we're ready for production.

If you find any errors in the program, you may report them using the issues section of Github, though this is the Alpha
version and is under heavy development. If you want a more stable version, we also offer a beta and production version.
